							<p class="text-center">Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in America by making
							it illegal to
							transfer money to them through any US bank or payment system. As a result of this law, most
							of the popular
							online casino networks such as Party Gaming and PlayTech left the United States. Overnight,
							online casino
							players found themselves being chased by the Federal government. But, after a fortnight, the
							online casino
							industry came up with a solution and new online casinos started taking root. These began to
							operate under a
							different business umbrella, and by doing that, rendered the transfer of money to and from
							them legal.
